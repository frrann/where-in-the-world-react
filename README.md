## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Frontend build tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) package - Library with popular icons for React projects
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) package - Routing library for React
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - API that provides information about countries around the world

### What I learned

This is my third project on this platform, and it's been a great experience. I've used more powerful tools for managing routes and fetching data. I wanted to push myself, so I added a bonus feature â€“ pagination. To make pagination and data fetching easier, I created separate custom hooks, which helped keep my code clean. As for the design, organizing SCSS modules and handling global styles has been a bit tricky, especially when dealing with dark mode.

### Continued development

Since this project doesn't involve a lot of data, for now, I'm sticking to local state to store country data. However, in future projects, I would like to use different state management tools.
